A recurrent neural network (RNN) distinguishes itself from traditional neural networks (ANNs) by its application in tasks such as stock price prediction, text generation, transcriptions, and machine translation.

Unlike conventional neural networks, where inputs and outputs operate independently, RNN's output relies on preceding elements within the sequence. Moreover, recurrent networks employ shared parameters across each layer, in contrast to feedforward networks, which have distinct weights for each node. In the RNN, the same weights are applied within each layer, and during gradient descent, adjustments to weights and biases are made individually to minimize loss.
